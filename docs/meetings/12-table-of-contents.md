## Running user study

- Sended it to people from previous user study.
- Some people are out, and will do it somewhen to the end of this week.
- So far it seems okey.

<br>

- Evaluation of the results:
    - Users searching for classes
        - Initially we wanted to see whether appropriate classes could be found.
        - The questionnaire reflects that.
        - How to measure acceptable solutions?
          - We know the "correct" ones.
          - But there are also solutions semantically correct, since the task description is abstract.
          - So how?
            - Based on the users confidence?
            - All availible properties present?
            - inheritance
              - but still subjective
            - I can go simply over the solutions and declare whether they are good or bad.
              - But that is subjective.
    - Modeling data structures
      - The same problem.
      - Things can be described in multiple ways.
      - People use different properties.
      - I have the correct solution, i can again mark the number of missing things.
      - But how to correctly denote what is missing.
    - How to measure correct solution?

## Intro

This paper is the continuation of the previous paper on Exploring importance measures for summarization.
It mainly explores additional methods for summarizations, but mainly it defines operator zoom in and zoom out on summary graph.
Based on the previous paper, the Betweenness measure was the most notable.
In this paper, they add spectral importance measures - PageRank and HITS.
They did not provide a specific evaluation on the returned importances.
But from the results of their experimentation, one can deduce that both the PageRank, HITS and Betweenness performed well.
With respect to HITS, it seemed it was the best one.

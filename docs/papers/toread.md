### To read but with less interest

- OntoSelect, OntoKhoj -> popularity based the more references to other o. the better.

- [Popularity driven Ontology ranking using Qualitative features](https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/40972/1/2019-07-02_iswc19-ranking-final.pdf) - CARRank, Termpicker, CBRBench, Word2Vec-> popularity based on citations per year and linear trend in citations history, not important to me, but it has a good introduction citating interesting papers and benchmarks

- [LOD search engine: A semantic search over linked data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-021-00687-0) 

- [A comparative application of multi criteria decision making in ontology ranking](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20485-3_5) (i used this to obtain the good searchers)

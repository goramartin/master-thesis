### To read but with less interest

### For reference

- OntoSelect, OntoKhoj -> popularity based the more references to other o. the better.

- [Popularity driven Ontology ranking using Qualitative features](https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/40972/1/2019-07-02_iswc19-ranking-final.pdf) - CARRank, Termpicker, CBRBench, Word2Vec-> popularity based on citations per year and linear trend in citations history, not important to me, but it has a good introduction citating interesting papers and benchmarks

- [Ranking Schemas by Focus](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353514217_Ranking_Schemas_by_Focus_A_Cognitively-Inspired_Approach) - 2021, defines class importance based on cathegorization of properties on a node (domains). This could be usefull, the problem is how to combine it with the number of properties is wikidata. Also they say it works well with noisy schemas and compare it with TF-IDF, BM25, CMM and DEM.

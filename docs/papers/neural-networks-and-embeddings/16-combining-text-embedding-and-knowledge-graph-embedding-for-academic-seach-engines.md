## Brief evaluations

The aim was to design a search engine for papers.
They used 2 methods for the search - word embeddings based on word2vec models (pv-cbow) and knowledge graph embeddings transE.
The evaluations showed that for the search word models were much better while kge were not so good - it also showed that combining the models did not receive a better performance.
But they showed that the transE embeddings were good for predicting links.

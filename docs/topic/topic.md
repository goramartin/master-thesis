1.  The class search in a large ontology
2. ... for semantic data modeling

## Annotation

When a user wants to reuse an ontology containing millions of classes without any previous knowledge, he is challenged to find classes regarding his interests. 
A one way to reuse a large ontology is a data structure creation process of the Dataspecer tool. 
The tool enables users to create data structures with the help of classes from various ontologies. 
The initial step of the creation process is a root selection phase. 
The phase tries to find a meaningful class from the chosen ontology that will serve as a root of the data structure. 

The goal of this thesis is to design, implement, integrate and evaluate multiple methods for the class search in the context of the root selection phase in the Dataspecer tool. 
The chosen ontology is the large Wikidata ontology. 
The root selection phase should disregard previously created data structures.
The designed solutions should consider structural features of the ontology and embedding methods.


- Co tam pridat?
  - adamuv nastroj? nestaci jen ten jeden priklad - co kdyz ho nestihne dodelat?
  - jak rict ze ten vyber nema byt iterativni - tj. postupne zpresnujici jak uzivatel klika?
  -  rict ze tam je baseline method string matching?
  -  rict neco o interfacu - chci co nejjednodussi

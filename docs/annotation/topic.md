**Annotation:**

When a user wants to reuse an ontology containing millions of classes without previous knowledge, he is challenged to find classes regarding his interest. One way to reuse a large ontology is a data structure creation process of the Dataspecer tool. The tool enables users to create data structures with the help of classes from various ontologies. The initial step of the creation process is the root selection phase. This phase aims to find a meaningful class from the chosen ontology that will serve as the root of the data structure. However, the search phase can be taxing in an ontology with millions of classes. One such ontology is the Wikidata ontology in the free and collaborative knowledge base Wikidata. 

This thesis aims to design, implement, and evaluate multiple methods for the class search in the context of the root selection phase in the Dataspecer tool connected to the Wikidata ontology. The root selection phase should disregard previously created data structures and the user's iterative search attempts. The designed solutions should consider structural features of the ontology and embedding methods while keeping the user interface as simple as possible.
